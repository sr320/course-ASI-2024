# Epigenetics and Climate Change

The implications of epigenetics in species living in coastal regions, particularly in the context of adaptation and resilience to climate change, are profound and multifaceted. Coastal ecosystems are among the most dynamic and vulnerable environments, often facing challenges such as rising sea levels, increased storm frequency, and changing salinity. Epigenetics plays a crucial role in how these species adapt and survive under such rapidly changing conditions.

1.  **Rapid Adaptation to Environmental Changes:** Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications can occur relatively quickly in response to environmental changes. This rapid epigenetic response can allow species in coastal regions to adjust to shifts in temperature, salinity, or other stress factors associated with climate change, without waiting for long-term evolutionary changes through natural selection.

2.  **Transgenerational Adaptation:** Some epigenetic changes can be passed from one generation to the next. This means that if a population is exposed to a certain stressor (like increased salinity), the offspring may inherit some of the adaptations that help them survive in that environment, even if they are not exposed to the stressor themselves. This transgenerational epigenetic inheritance can be crucial for the survival of species in rapidly changing environments.

3.  **Developmental Plasticity:** Epigenetics contributes to developmental plasticity, where organisms can modify their development in response to environmental cues. This can result in changes in physical characteristics or behaviors that are better suited to the new environment, enhancing survival and reproduction.

4.  **Resilience to Extreme Events:** Coastal regions are often subject to extreme weather events like hurricanes or floods. Epigenetic mechanisms can contribute to the resilience of species by enabling rapid stress responses and recovery, ensuring survival and continuity.

5.  **Community Dynamics and Ecosystem Functioning:** The epigenetic responses of individual species can influence broader community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. For example, if a key species develops an epigenetic adaptation that alters its role in the ecosystem, it can have cascading effects on other species and overall ecosystem health.

6.  **Potential for Conservation and Management Strategies:** Understanding the epigenetic mechanisms underlying adaptation in coastal species can inform conservation efforts. It can lead to strategies that support the natural adaptive capacity of these species, thereby enhancing ecosystem resilience to climate change.

Coastal ecosystems are characterized by dynamic environmental variations and anthropogenic impacts, making the role of epigenetic mechanisms in adaptation and resilience paramount (Mounger et al., 2021). Epigenetic variation has been found to be high in coastal foundation species, indicating its importance in enabling species to cope with diverse and challenging coastal environments (Mounger et al., 2020). This is further supported by the fact that individuals with similar genetic profiles exhibit divergent epigenetic profiles, suggesting that epigenetic changes may be associated with environmental heterogeneity (Lira et al., 2010). Additionally, rapid phenotypic alterations mediated by epigenetic mechanisms are particularly important for the persistence of species in dynamic ecosystems, such as those in coastal regions (Mounger et al., 2021). Furthermore, the capacity of species to cope with disturbances and adapt while maintaining essential functions, as defined by coastal resilience, is influenced by epigenetic mechanisms (Raub et al., 2021). It has been suggested that genotypic diversity can replace the role of species diversity in species-poor coastal ecosystems, buffering against extreme climatic events (Reusch et al., 2005). This is significant in the context of climate change, as coastal areas are increasingly at risk from both natural and human-induced hazards (Almutairi et al., 2020). Moreover, the sensitivity of coastal species to ocean acidification highlights the need to understand the epigenetic effects of environmental stressors on coastal species (Pousse et al., 2022). In conclusion, epigenetics has profound implications for species living in coastal regions, particularly in the context of adaptation and resilience in the face of climate change. The high epigenetic variation observed in coastal species, coupled with the capacity of epigenetic mechanisms to enable rapid phenotypic alterations, underscores the importance of epigenetics in facilitating species' ability to cope with diverse and challenging coastal environments.

# Epigenetics in Ecological and Evolutionary Processes

Epigenetics plays a crucial role in the ecological and evolutionary processes of various organisms, particularly plants and animals. The interaction between epigenetics and the environment has been a subject of increasing interest (Feil & Fraga, 2012). Studies have shown that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and chromatin modifications, mediate responses to environmental cues and play a significant role in the adaptation of species to changing environmental conditions (Consuegra & López, 2016).

Furthermore, epigenetic diversity has been found to enhance the productivity and stability of plant populations, indicating its ecological implications (Latzel et al., 2013). Additionally, evidence from pyrosequencing suggests that natural variation in animal personality is associated with DNA methylation, highlighting the relevance of epigenetics in understanding behavioral consistency and its ecological and evolutionary implications (Verhulst et al., 2016).

The significance of epigenetics for plant ecology has been emphasized, with a call for increased transfer of knowledge and methods from model species research to genomes of evolutionarily divergent species, as well as the examination of responses to complex natural environments at a more mechanistic level (Richards et al., 2017). Furthermore, the opportunities and limitations of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing in plant ecological epigenomics have been explored, aiming to understand the unique contributions of epigenetic mechanisms to ecological and evolutionary processes (Paun et al., 2018).

Marine environmental epigenetics has also been studied, providing insights applicable to critical issues such as aquaculture, biomonitoring, and biological invasions, thereby improving the understanding and prediction of marine taxa responses to global climate change (Eirín‐López & Putnam, 2019).

In conclusion, epigenetics has emerged as a crucial factor in ecological and evolutionary processes, influencing the adaptation, productivity, and stability of plant populations, as well as the behavioral consistency of animals. The interaction between epigenetics and the environment has significant implications for understanding and predicting the responses of various organisms to environmental changes.

# Invasive Species

Epigenetics plays a significant role in the expansion of invasive species, contributing to their adaptability and success in new environments. The rapid adaptation of invasive species, particularly in response to selection pressures generated by novel environments, involves epigenetic modulation as an adaptive strategy (Carneiro & Lyko, 2020). Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, have been suggested to compensate for losses in genetic variability and contribute to adaptive phenotypic plasticity in invasive species (Bock et al., 2015). Furthermore, epigenetic diversity has been proposed to facilitate the expansion of invasive species by acting as an alternative source of variation in areas with low genetic diversity (Sheldon et al., 2018). This plasticity acquired through epigenetic changes explains the ability of invasive species to expand and colonize new ecosystems, particularly in the presence of reduced genetic diversity due to founder effects (Ardura et al., 2017). Studies have also indicated that epigenetic mechanisms impact several phenotypic traits and may be important for the ecology and evolution of invasive species (Schrey et al., 2012). Additionally, epigenetic variation has been suggested to compensate for decreased genetic variation during introductions, highlighting its potential role in facilitating the success of invasive species in new environments (Schrey et al., 2012). The expansion of invasive species challenges our understanding of the process of adaptation, and epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly recognized as integral to the adaptation of species facing environmental changes (Chisholm et al., 2016). In conclusion, epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in the expansion of invasive species by facilitating rapid adaptation, compensating for genetic variability, and contributing to phenotypic plasticity. The plasticity acquired through epigenetic changes enables invasive species to thrive in new environments and colonize new ecosystems, ultimately contributing to their success as invasive species.

Abstract: Epigenetic variation is often characterized by modifications to DNA that do not alter the underlying nucleotide sequence, but can influence behavior, morphology, and physiological phenotypes by affecting gene expression and protein synthesis. In this review, we consider how the emerging field of ecological epigenetics (eco-epi) aims to use epigenetic variation to explain ecologically relevant phenotypic variation and predict evolutionary trajectories that are important in conservation. Here, we focus on how epigenetic data have contributed to our understanding of wild populations, including plants, animals, and fungi. First, we identified published eco-epi literature and found that there was limited taxonomic and ecosystem coverage and that, by necessity of available technology, these studies have most often focused on the summarized epigenome rather than locus- or nucleotide-level epigenome characteristics. We also found that while many studies focused on adaptation and heritability of the epigenome, the field has thematically expanded into topics such as disease ecology and epigenome-based ageing of individuals. In the second part of our synthesis, we discuss key insights that have emerged from the epigenetic field broadly and use these to preview the path toward integration of epigenetics into ecology. Specifically, we suggest moving focus to nucleotide-level differences in the epigenome rather than whole-epigenome data and that we incorporate several facets of epigenome characterization (e.g., methylation, chromatin structure). Finally, we also suggest that incorporation of behavior and stress data will be critical to the process of fully integrating eco-epi data into ecology, conservation, and evolutionary biology.

The importance of DNA methylation in plastic responses to environmental change and evolutionary dynamics is increasingly recognized. Here, we provide a Perspective piece on the diverse roles of DNA methylation on broad evolutionary timescales, including (i) short-term transient acclimation, (ii) stable phenotypic evolution, and (iii) genomic evolution. We show that epigenetic responses vary along a continuum, ranging from short-term acclimatory responses in variable environments within a generation to long-term modifications in populations and species. DNA methylation thus unlocks additional potential for organisms to rapidly acclimate to their environment over short timeframes. If these changes affect fitness, they can circumvent the need for adaptive changes at the genome level. However, methylation has a complex reciprocal relationship with genetic variation as it can be genetically controlled, yet it can also induce point mutations and contribute to genomic evolution. When habitats remain constant over many generations, or populations are separated across habitats, initially plastic phenotypes can become hardwired through epigenetically facilitated mutagenesis. It remains unclear under what circumstances plasticity contributes to evolutionary outcomes, and when plastic changes will become permanently encoded into genotype. We highlight how studies investigating the evolution of epigenetic plasticity need to carefully consider how plasticity in methylation state could evolve among different evolutionary scenarios, the possible phenotypic outcomes, its effects on genomic evolution, and the proximate energetic and ultimate fitness costs of methylation. We argue that accumulating evidence suggests that DNA methylation can contribute toward evolution on various timescales, spanning a continuum from acclimatory plasticity to genomic evolution.
