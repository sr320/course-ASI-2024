    "text": "Course Title: Epigenetic Phenomena Connecting Climate Change and Coastal Marine Species\nCourse Duration: 1 week\nCourse Description:\nThis one-week intensive graduate-level course explores the intriguing intersection of climate change, epigenetics, and marine invertebrate physiology, with a significant emphasis on the application of functional genomics. The course aims to highlight the substantial yet often overlooked role of marine invertebrates in coastal ecosystems, underlining their ecological significance and their responses to climate change at an epigenetic level.\nThe course starts by establishing a strong foundational understanding of epigenetics, climate change, and marine invertebrate physiology. Following this, students will delve into the intricate role of functional genomics in understanding these connections. Real-world examples will be extensively used to discuss how changes in climate directly and indirectly lead to alterations in the epigenetic mechanisms of various coastal marine invertebrates.\nBy the end of the course, students should have a comprehensive understanding of how climate change can influence the epigenetics and physiology of coastal marine invertebrates and the potential broader implications for marine ecosystems. The course is suitable for students with a basic understanding of genetics and climate science, although students from all disciplines are welcome as the course starts from foundational principles.\nThrough a mix of lectures, discussions, and interactive case studies, students will develop a nuanced understanding of the course topics. This course is highly recommended for students interested in marine biology, genetics, climate change, and conservation biology.\nObjectives:\nObjective 1: Understanding the Interplay between Climate Change, Epigenetics, and Marine Invertebrate Physiology\nThe first objective of the course is to help students gain a comprehensive understanding of how climate change impacts the physiological processes of marine invertebrates, especially through the lens of epigenetics. Students will learn about the fundamentals of marine invertebrate physiology and the various ways in which climate change-related stressors can influence these physiological systems, causing significant changes at an epigenetic level.\nObjective 2: Gaining Proficiency in Functional Genomics\nThe second objective is to ensure that students gain proficiency in the methodologies and applications of functional genomics, particularly in studying the epigenetic changes in marine invertebrates in response to climate change. Students will learn about various genomic techniques, their applications, and how to interpret data from these studies to gain insights into the epigenetic responses of marine invertebrates to climate stressors.\nObjective 3: Developing Skills for Analyzing and Evaluating Scientific Research\nThe third objective is to develop students’ ability to critically analyze and evaluate scientific literature in the field of marine invertebrate epigenetics and climate change. Through case studies and discussions on recent research, students will hone their skills in analyzing experimental designs, interpreting results, and understanding the broader implications of research findings for climate change adaptation and marine conservation efforts.\nContents:\nThis intensive course is divided into five modules:\n\nBasics of Epigenetics and Climate Change: This module provides an overview of climate change science and the principles of epigenetics. We discuss how the two fields intersect and introduce the concept of environmental epigenetics.\nPhysiology of Marine Invertebrates: This module focuses on the essential aspects of marine invertebrate physiology, covering topics such as feeding, digestion, reproduction, and response to environmental stressors.\nImpact of Climate Change on Marine Invertebrate Physiology: This section explores the specific impacts of various climate change-related factors, such as ocean acidification, temperature rise, and salinity changes on the physiology of marine invertebrates.\nFunctional Genomics and Epigenetics: This module delves into the methodologies and applications of functional genomics in studying epigenetic changes. Various genomic techniques such as DNA methylation analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and RNA sequencing will be discussed.\nCase Studies and Current Research: The final module will involve an in-depth examination of recent research studies in the field. Students will be encouraged to critically analyze the studies and discuss the implications of the findings on our understanding of climate change impacts and the role of epigenetics in marine invertebrate adaptation.\n\nMethodology:\nThrough a mix of lectures, discussions, and interactive data analysis, students will develop a nuanced understanding of the course topics. This course is highly recommended for students interested in marine biology, genetics, climate change, and conservation biology. The general format will be lecture in the morning and interactive data analysis in the afternoon. The latter will primarily involve using R and bash.\nBibliography:\nCrandall, Grace, Rhonda Elliott Thompson, Benoit Eudeline, Brent Vadopalas, Emma Timmins-Schiffman, and Steven Roberts. 2022. “Proteomic Response of Early Juvenile Pacific Oysters (Crassostrea Gigas) to Temperature.” PeerJ 10 (October): e14158. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14158.\nCrandall, Grace, Pamela C.
